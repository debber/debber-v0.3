Before 'release'

~~1. While generating each "meta" file, check resources -> template [file] -> template [string]~~
~~2. Guts of the deb file reader/validator.~~
3. Strip out any more unessentials.
~~4. Deal with resources which shouldn't really be autogenerated - rules (non-Go packages) and changelog.~~
5. Ensure all files are in source packages. Check against a dpkg-source build. Include a bash script for this.

Secondary
---------

1. Complete test suite & example suite
2. Complete docs 
3. Investigate nesting reader of a .tar.gz within a .ar file (no intermediate file).
4. Investigate building bin packages directly from source packages.
